###How To Run Scenarios (V1)
  + Simply press the Green Play Button in the Tool Bar (ApplicationGui.Java)
  	+ Alternatively, you can right click "ApplicationGui.Java" and hit "Run As -> Java Application"
  + The program will immediately run and go through all the scenario's. In order to easily see each 
  	scenario, go to the "TracePanel" tab. Here you can see the different scenario's running with print statements.
    The General City Print Statements show by default, whereas all the other type of print statements are hidden.
    You can hide the General City Print Statements, and click to show another scenario's print statements
    in order to see the different scenarios running. 
  + *Since we have implemented all the main scenarios, we have not implemented a configuration file under the time constraints.  However all normative scenerios can be tracked via the Trace Panel.*
  + We recommend restarting the application each time.
  + In order to run the test cases, please open the respective directory (market.test, bank.test, restaurant.test, housing.test), right click the test you want to run, and run as JUNIT test.
